## What we struggled with 🙈

- Making the backend and frontend communicate with each other (at first)
- Improving on the api function we looked at this week 
- npm issues - one computer reverting to old version of npm caused bugs
- Our site breaking unexpectedly at the end of the day

- We weren't able to use input validation to the back-end with our site design

## Questions from us 🧐
